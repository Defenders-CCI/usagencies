{{Politics of the United States}}
This is a list of '''agencies''' of the '''United States federal government'''.

Legislative definitions of a federal [[Government agency|agency]] are varied, and even contradictory, and the official [[United States Government Manual]] offers no definition.{{sfn|Fischer|2011|pages=1-2}}{{sfn|Federal Register|2013}} While the [[Administrative Procedure Act (United States)|Administrative Procedure Act]] definition of "agency" applies to most [[Executive (government)|executive branch]] agencies, Congress may define an agency however it chooses in enabling legislation, and subsequent litigation, often involving the [[Freedom of Information Act (United States)|Freedom of Information Act]] and the [[Government in the Sunshine Act]]. These further cloud attempts to enumerate a list of agencies.{{sfn|Lewis|Selin|2013|pages=13-14}}{{sfn|Kamensky|2013}}

The executive branch of [[Federal government of the United States|the federal government]] includes the [[Executive Office of the President]] and the [[United States federal executive departments]] (whose secretaries belong to the [[Cabinet of the United States|Cabinet]]). Employees of the majority of these agencies are considered [[United States civil service|civil servants]].

The majority of the [[independent agencies of the United States government]] are also classified as executive agencies (they are independent in that they are not subordinated under a Cabinet position). There are a small number of independent agencies that are not considered part of the executive branch, such as the [[Library of Congress]] and [[Congressional Budget Office]], which are administered directly by [[United States Congress|Congress]] and thus are [[Legislature|legislative branch]] agencies. The status of these agencies is an open question, however, as Judge [[Brett Kavanaugh]] noted in a brief concurrence in ''SoundExchange, Inc. v. Librarian of Congress''. There is one independent agency in the [[Federal government of the United States|judicial branch]], the [[United States Sentencing Commission]].
